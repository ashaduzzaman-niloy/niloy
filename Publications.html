			<td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Abstract: </b>A challenging engineering optimization problem in electrical power generation is the unit commitment problem (UCP). Determining the scheduling for the economic consumption of production assets over a specific period is the premier objective of UCP. This paper presents a take on solving UCP with Binary Slime Mould Algorithm (BSMA). SMA is a recently created optimization method that draws inspiration from nature and mimics the vegetative growth of slime mould. A binarized SMA with constraint handling is proposed and implemented to UCP to generate optimal scheduling for available power resources. To test BSMA as a UCP optimizer, IEEE standard generating systems ranging from 10 to 100 units along with IEEE 118-bus system are used, and the results are then compared with existing approaches. The comparison reveals the superiority of BSMA over all the classical and evolutionary approaches and most of the hybridized methods considered in this paper in terms of total cost and convergence characteristics.</td>

			<td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, a Chaotic Singer Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CS-GOA) is proposed to solve the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch optimization problem. The premier objectives of CEED problem are to find the minimum fuel cost of power generation for the lowest possible pollutant emission, which is achieved simultaneously by a proper distribution of power generation duty among the generators. Price Penalty Factor (PPF) methodology is used to transform CEED into a single-objective optimization problem. A Chaotic Singer version of Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm is proposed and tested for solving CEED. The performance assessment tests consist of four different benchmark test systems with complexities such as different load demands and Valve-point loading of turbine. The attained simulation results highlight the superiority of CS-GOA in solving CEED problem in aspects of reduced fuel cost, emission and rapid convergence.</td>

			<td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, the Slime Mould optimization Algorithm (SMOA) is proposed to find a cost effective solution to the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem. CEED is a multi-objective optimization problem where the main focus is on reducing power generation cost as well as the emission produced by the power generation while satisfying the regulatory constraints. With the term Price Penalty Factor (PPF), the multi-objective CEED is transformed into single-objective optimization problem. Then the SMOA is implemented on four benchmark test systems with complications such as valve-point loading effect and transmission losses. The test results were compared with other renowned optimization methods that were used in previous researches. The comparisons have shown superiority of SMOA over the other methods in terms of cost and emission reduction.</td>
