			<td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, a Chaotic Singer Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CS-GOA) is proposed to solve the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch optimization problem. The premier objectives of CEED problem are to find the minimum fuel cost of power generation for the lowest possible pollutant emission, which is achieved simultaneously by a proper distribution of power generation duty among the generators. Price Penalty Factor (PPF) methodology is used to transform CEED into a single-objective optimization problem. A Chaotic Singer version of Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm is proposed and tested for solving CEED. The performance assessment tests consist of four different benchmark test systems with complexities such as different load demands and Valve-point loading of turbine. The attained simulation results highlight the superiority of CS-GOA in solving CEED problem in aspects of reduced fuel cost, emission and rapid convergence.</td>

			<td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, the Slime Mould optimization Algorithm (SMOA) is proposed to find a cost effective solution to the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem. CEED is a multi-objective optimization problem where the main focus is on reducing power generation cost as well as the emission produced by the power generation while satisfying the regulatory constraints. With the term Price Penalty Factor (PPF), the multi-objective CEED is transformed into single-objective optimization problem. Then the SMOA is implemented on four benchmark test systems with complications such as valve-point loading effect and transmission losses. The test results were compared with other renowned optimization methods that were used in previous researches. The comparisons have shown superiority of SMOA over the other methods in terms of cost and emission reduction.</td>
